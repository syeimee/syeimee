# About Me
・My name is Syeimee, pronounced "Shemy." I currently work as an engineer in Okayama.

・I was born on November 17, 1993, in Hiroshima. I studied biology in university and conducted research on tumor immunology in graduate school. After that, I moved into the education industry, where I taught mathematics as a lecturer for six years. With a desire to improve the education industry, I began learning about programming, and now I work as an engineer.

・In the future, I aspire to become a full-stack engineer. To that end, I have created a learning repository for both backend and frontend development.
